Sandbox!
========
## A place for me to play with interesting things.
### And learn about them as well.

```pygame``` is my play testing with the pygame module for python. Working and learning here, then eventually moving it into the Leap-Paintwar project. However, may drop it in favor of C++ with SDL instead.
